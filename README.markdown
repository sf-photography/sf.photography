## sf-photography on the web

Web site based on the [Jasper2](https://jekyller.github.io/jasper2) theme.

Style and config tweaks by Greg.


## Getting Started

Requirement: ruby.

1. Clone the repository.
2. `bundle install` to install required gems.
3. Optional: `npm install` (need to have node installed first) for `gulp` if you need to re-generate the CSS.
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a local instance of the site.

## Adding a new post

See `_posts/2018-06-24-greg-sf-zoo.markdown` for an example of how to format your own post.

1. If this is your first post, add yourself to `_data/authors.yml`
2. Add a new file to `_posts/`
3. Add your images to a new directory in `images/`
4. Edit the post

Publishing is still a manual process; you should ping Greg to push the big green PUBLISH button when you're all done.
